At other times turning points are endings, such as when I see clearly the need to stop festering resentments or crippling self-seeking. Many shortcomings tempt me daily; therefore, I also have daily opportunities to become aware of them. In one form or another, many of my character defects appear daily: self-condemnation, anger, running away, being prideful,wanting to get even, or acting out of grandiosity.Attempting half measures to eliminate these defects merely paralyzes my efforts to change.

It was their guarantee that no one could bar them from A.A.Today I feel enduring gratitude for the spiritual development the Tradition has brought me. I don't seek out people obviously different from myself. Tradition Three,concentrating on the one way I am similar to others,brought me to know and help every kind of alcoholic, justs they have helped me. Charlotte, the atheist, showed me higher standards of ethics and honor; Clay, of another race,taught me patience; Winslow, who is gay, led me by example into true compassion; Young Megan says that seeing me at meetings, sober thirty years, keeps her coming back. Tradition Three insured that we would get what weened—each other."

When I stopped drinking I began a lifetime processor recovery from unruly emotions, painful relationships, and unmanageable situations. This process is too much for most of us without help from a Higher Power and our friends in the Fellowship. When I began working the Steps of the A.A.program, many of these tangled threads unraveled but, little by little, the most broken places of my life straightened out.One day at a time, almost imperceptibly, I healed. Like thermostat being turned down, my fears diminished. I began to experience moments of contentment. My emotions became less volatile. I am now once again a part of the human family."
