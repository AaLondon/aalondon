Prisons & probation

Responsibility for sponsorship of prison groups has been placed by Conference with the Intergroup and is exercised through the Intergroup Prison Liaison Officer. As a member of Alcoholics Anonymous you are there by permission of the Governor and staff and it must be remembered that every Governor, although working within a national framework, has the right of decision in his or her own institution. Familiarity with prisons in the local area and a thorough knowledge of the AA Service Handbook for Great Britain are vital before accepting the role of Prison Liaison Officer.

Prison group sponsors are appointed according to the Intergroup conscience. It is recommended that sponsors have a minimum of three yearsâ€™ continuous sobriety. Security clearance is invariably necessary. Wherever possible, a team of AA sponsors should be maintained so that inmates will gain a broader view of how AA works. So far as the Fellowship of AA is concerned, female members may be included in the panel of agreed sponsors for male prisons, provided they are accompanied by a male AA member, or male members on the panel for female prisons, provided they are accompanied by a female AA member, subject to the approval of the Governor.

As with all meetings, it is desirable that prison groups discuss the whole of the AA programme of recovery using every opportunity to introduce the Steps and Traditions and referring to the Big Book. In this way, it is possible to make the inmate member aware that he or she can live the AA way of life prior to release. Prison group members should, wherever possible, be encouraged to take an active part in their Group in accordance with AA Traditions and, whenever possible, prison sponsors should adopt only a supporting role. AA members who are invited to speak at a prison Group meeting may also require security clearance.
