Electronic communications

The principal role of the electronic communications liaison officer, ECLO, is one of liaison, communication and coordination between groups, intergroup, region, and the electronics communications sub-committee – and to facilitate correlation and dissemination of relevant information between these principal service areas. Therefore a good understanding of the Traditions and Service and Structure Handbooks is more important to the role than technical knowledge.

A minimum of three years’ sobriety is recommended, as is a general competence with the use of computers. If desired, a committee of technically skilled members could be formed to assist the ECLO in setting up, maintaining and updating any local website, with the ECLO acting as Chair of this committee. Such a committee would provide an opportunity for less experienced but technically skilled members to engage in service.

The ECLO is the liaison point between the local fellowship and the electronic communications sub-committee, advising the intergroup and region on the availability and use of the facilities available on the AAGB website.

ECLOs are also responsible for checking the accuracy of any local information posted on the website (ie meeting list addresses and postcodes and local webpage content) to ensure that up to date, accurate local information is published.

ECLOs can encourage members of their intergroup to obtain AA email addresses in order to promote continuity in the role. In order to do this they can monitor their intergroup entry in the Confidential Directory.
